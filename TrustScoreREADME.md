## 🎯 Overview

The **Organization Trust Score** is a composite metric that quantifies an organization's credibility and risk across multiple dimensions of trust. It answers the fundamental question: *"How much can we trust this business?"* by evaluating key facets including leadership, finances, compliance, identity, and reputation.

### Key Benefits

- 🤖 **AI Agent Compatibility** - Enables automated trust decisions in agent-to-agent interactions
- 📊 **Quantified Trust** - Transforms subjective trust into measurable metrics
- 🔍 **Multi-Dimensional Analysis** - Evaluates trust across 5 core pillars
- ✅ **Verifiable Evidence** - Based on attested data from authoritative sources
- 🎯 **Context-Aware** - Adaptable scoring based on transaction context

### Use Case Example

When a customer's AI assistant is about to transact with a provider's AI agent, the assistant can consult the provider's Trust Score to make an informed decision about proceeding with the transaction, applying safeguards, or declining the interaction.

## 🧮 Scoring Algorithm

### Weighted Average Formula

```markdown
TrustScore = (w_L × Leadership_score + 
              w_I × Identity_score + 
              w_F × Finance_score + 
              w_C × Compliance_score + 
              w_R × Reputation_score) 
              ÷ (w_L + w_I + w_F + w_C + w_R)
```

### Current Weights
- **Leadership**: 25%
- **Identity**: 25%
- **Finance**: 20%
- **Compliance**: 20%
- **Reputation**: 10%

### Score Ranges & Interpretation

| Score Range | Trust Level | Description | Action |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 80-100 | 🟢 **High Trust** | Very trustworthy business | Proceed with confidence |
| 60-79 | 🟡 **Moderate Trust** | Generally trustworthy with minor concerns | Proceed with standard precautions |
| 40-59 | 🟠 **Low Trust** | Some trust concerns present | Proceed with enhanced safeguards |
| 0-39 | 🔴 **High Risk** | Significant trust issues | Decline or require guarantees |

### Algorithm Features

- **Gating Conditions**: Critical failures (e.g., identity verification) can force low scores
